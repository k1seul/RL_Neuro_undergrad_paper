hanseul's undergrad research curiosity based RL for dynamic reward environment 
## Introduction

This paper is my undergraduate thesis about comparing artificial agent(Deep Q Reinforcement Learning agent) and natural agent(Rhesus monkey) in 3D navigational task.
This paper showes novel curiosity maximum entropy reinforcement learning model which mixes goal-based external reward function and curiosity-based internal reward function in non-linear way. The model structure can be seen from figure below.
